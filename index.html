            <p>At the beginning of the pandemic, I spent most of my time inside playing video games as I was a junior with no job heading into spring break. As we all know, that spring break turned into much more than that. Eventually I managed to land a few jobs since then. These days I either spend my time at work, class, or inside watching anime and playing video games.</p>
